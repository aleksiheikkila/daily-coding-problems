""" Day 6. XOR linked list. Hard.


An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. 
Instead of each node holding next and prev fields, it holds a field named both, 
which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. 

Implement an XOR linked list; it has 
 - an add(element) which adds the element to the end, and
 - a get(index) which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), 
you can assume you have access to get_pointer and dereference_pointer functions 
that converts between nodes and memory addresses.


=======================
Need to fake a little in python.

In Python, could utilize id() (however it's not memory loc in all cases/implementations).

Or perhaps use list to represent memory, and list indices are the memory locations / addresses.
Let's use this.

=======================
In the XOR linked list, instead of storing actual memory addresses, 
every node stores the XOR of addresses of previous and next nodes.

While traversing the list we need to remember the address of the previously 
accessed node in order to calculate the next nodeâ€™s address

Consider XOR Linked list of A - B - C - D.
For example: When we are at node B, we must have the address of A. 
XOR of address(A) and 'both' value of B gives us the address(D)

XOR has this property:
If T = num_a ^ num_b, then
T ^ num_a = num_b
T ^ num_b = num_a
